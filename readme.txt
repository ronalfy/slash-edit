Edit your posts or pages with a simple "/edit" at the end

== Description ==

Edit posts, pages, or custom post types by adding a "/edit" to the end of the URL.  If you are not logged in, you will be prompted to log in in order to edit the item.

The "/edit" functionality also works on author and taxonomy archives, and if you have a page assigned as your front page of your site.

This is useful if:

* You are not logged in, and want an easy shortcut to edit an item.
* You hate the admin bar and have disabled it, but still want an easy shortcut to edit an item.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How do I use the plugin? =
Just browse to the post, page, or custom post type, and add "/edit" to the end (e.g., http://domain.com/posts/edit).

You'll need <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Permalinks#mod_rewrite:_.22Pretty_Permalinks.22">pretty permalinks enabled</a>, which pretty much everyone already does.

= Will you allow quick editing of categories and other items later? =
It's already in there :D

= What about attachment pages? =
That one I couldn't figure out.  Patches welcome.

= Where are the options? =
No options :)

= English is not my first language.  Can I change the "/edit" into something else? =

Yep, just throw <a href="https://gist.github.com/ronalfy/cbbc1599bda2811c9a86">this code</a> in a <a href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/what-why-and-how-tos-of-creating-a-site-specific-wordpress-plugin/">Site-specific plugin</a>.

Just keep in mind that whatever you choose to override with must be alphanumeric characters.  Something like edición will be parsed as edicion.

If you choose to use this filter, you'll need to <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Settings_Permalinks_Screen">update your permalinks</a> or deactivate and reactivate the Slash Edit plugin.
