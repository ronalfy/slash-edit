Edit your posts or pages with a simple "/edit" at the end

== Description ==

Edit posts, pages, or custom post types by adding a "/edit" to the end of the URL.  If you are not logged in, you will be prompted to log in in order to edit the item.

The "/edit" functionality also works on author and taxonomy archives.

This is useful if:

* You are not logged in, and want an easy shortcut to edit an item.
* You hate the admin bar and have disabled it, but still want an easy shortcut to edit an item.

== Installation ==

1. Just unzip and upload the "slash-edit" folder to your '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How do I use the plugin? =
Just browse to the post, page, or custom post type, and add "/edit" to the end (e.g., http://domain.com/posts/edit).

You'll need <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Permalinks#mod_rewrite:_.22Pretty_Permalinks.22">pretty permalinks enabled</a>, which pretty much everyone already does.

= Will you allow quick editing of categories and other items later? =
It's already in there :D

= What about attachment pages? =
That one I couldn't figure out.  Patches welcome.

= Where are the options? =
No options :)
