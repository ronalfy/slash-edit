Slash Edit for WordPress
======================

Slash Edit for WordPress 3.9.1+

## Description

Edit posts, pages, or custom post types by adding a "/edit" to the end of the URL.  If you are not logged in, you will be prompted to log in in order to edit the item.

The "/edit" functionality also works on author and taxonomy archives.

This is the awesome place where the developmental (growing?) version of the plugin lives.  For more stable releases, check out: https://wordpress.org/plugins/slash-edit/

This is useful if:

<ul>
<li>You are not logged in, and want an easy shortcut to edit an item.</li>
<li>You hate the admin bar and have disabled it, but still want an easy shortcut to edit an item.</li>
</ul>

A filter is available if you want to change "/edit" to "/anything".

## Installation

1. Just unzip and upload the "slash-edit" folder to your '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

## Frequently Asked Questions
###How do I use the plugin?
Just browse to the post, page, or custom post type, and add "/edit" to the end (e.g., http://domain.com/posts/edit).

You'll need <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Permalinks#mod_rewrite:_.22Pretty_Permalinks.22">pretty permalinks enabled</a>, which pretty much everyone already does.

###How do I change the "/edit" to something else?
Just throw <a href="https://gist.github.com/ronalfy/cbbc1599bda2811c9a86">this code</a> in a <a href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/what-why-and-how-tos-of-creating-a-site-specific-wordpress-plugin/">Site-specific plugin</a>.

Just keep in mind that whatever you choose to override with must be alphanumeric characters.  Something like edici√≥n will be parsed as edicion.

If you choose to use this filter, you'll need to <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Settings_Permalinks_Screen">update your permalinks</a> or deactivate and reactivate the Slash Edit plugin.
